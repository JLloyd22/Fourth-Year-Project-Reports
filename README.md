This repository contains three projects I worked on during my final year of my MMath degree at Durham University, covering multiple topics. 
My DLAI (Deep learning & artificial intelligence) report covers using multiple deep and machine learning methods to create a decision rule for a classification task on big data. It also contains an analysis of Chen and Bruna's 2022 paper titled 'Beyond the Edge of Stability via Two-Step Gradient Updates'.
My NPS (Non-parametric statistics) report covers using bayesian non-parametric methods to discover hidden patterns and clusters in data. It mainly focusses on using the BNPmix package in R, which uses Pitman-Yor process to perform density estimation.
My UQ (Uncertainty Quantification) report covers emulators to estimate complex functions.
Please give them a read if you're interested!
